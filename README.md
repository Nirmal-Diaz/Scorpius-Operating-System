# Scorpius-Operating-System
A web based, OS-like environment made entirely using web related technology

Installation
------------
Note: This project is extensively tested on a WAMP environment. Therefore a simillar environment is recommended.
1. Simply copy all the files into a root directory (i.e. a directory with only the files in this repo)
2. User's media files (i.e. mp3, mp4, webm, txt etc.) can be copied to their respective directories located inside the "User" directory (this is optional).
3. Request "Start.html" from the server.

Purpose
-------
1. Learn web related technology as a beginner (eg. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Apache HTTP Server etc.)
2. Learn how to get things done in the web without using 3rd party libraries.
(Only the core APIs of their respective technologies are used in making of this project)
Note: Because of the learning-oriented approach, comments are used per-line basis in most places.
